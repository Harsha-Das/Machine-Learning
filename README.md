# Machine-Learning
  Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.  I have tried to use as many concepts as I could.

-Linear Regression With One Variable 
-Linear Regression Multiple Variables 
-Gradient Descent 
-Categorical Variables and One Hot Encoding 
-Logistic regression: Binary Classification 
-Logistic Regression: Multiclass Classification 
-Decision Tree Classification 
-Random Forest Classification 
-KFold Cross-Validation 
-Clustering With K Means 
-Silhouette Analysis 
-Hierarchical Clustering 
-Naive Bayes Classification 
-GridSearchCV & Hyperparameter Tuning for SVM 
-L1 and L2 Regularization (Ridge and Lasso Regression)
