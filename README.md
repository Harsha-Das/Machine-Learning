# Machine-Learning
Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.  I have tried to use as many concepts as I could.

-Linear Regression Multiple Variables 

-Gradient Descent 

-Categorical Variables and One Hot Encoding 

-Logistic regression: Binary Classification 

-Logistic Regression: Multiclass Classification 

-Decision Tree Classification 

-Random Forest Classification 

-KFold Cross-Validation 

-Clustering With K Means 

-Silhouette Analysis 

-Hierarchical Clustering 

-Naive Bayes Classification 

-GridSearchCV & Hyperparameter Tuning for SVM 

-L1 and L2 Regularization (Ridge and Lasso Regression)
